Data
This repository will contain all the activities I undertake to acquire new skills in the field of data.

**Day 1:** I studied and researched the essential skills needed in data analysis and created a two-month plan for my learning journey. I also learned the basics of Power BI and applied my knowledge by working on a project using online resources.

**Day 2:** I realized the importance of gaining experience with both major BI tools, so I started learning Tableau Desktop. I completed a beginner-level project to enhance my skills in Tableau.

**Day 3:** I reviewed all the knowledge I had gained in the past two days and created another project using online resources. I also planned to focus on SQL on the fourth day. Since I’m already familiar with MySQL, this should make the learning process smoother.

**Day 4:** Today, I completed all the basic to advanced SQL tutorials and worked on a project that involved performing operations on SQL data. Some of the topics I covered include: GROUP BY, ORDER BY, creating stored procedures, using UNION, string and window functions, subqueries, temporary tables, CTEs, and many more concepts.

**Day 5:**  On Day 5, I implemented all the queries and functions that I learned on Day 4 to build a solid project. I focused on cleaning the data as thoroughly as possible by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, handling or manipulating null or blank spaces, and removing unnecessary rows or columns to ensure the data was as clean as possible.

**Day 6 :**On day 6 of my learning journey, I completed three SQL projects, each involving a mix of beginner to advanced-level questions using three distinct datasets. These projects helped me apply the concepts I learned on day 5. Additionally, I started the CS50 course today and completed a lesson on querying, which further expanded my understanding of SQL.

**Day 7: **Today, I completed Lesson 2, "Relating Databases," in the CS50: Introduction to Database with SQL course. Alongside this, I submitted three projects—two from Problem Set 0 and one from Problem Set 1. Working on these projects helped me deepen my understanding of subqueries and other SQL keywords, enhancing my practical knowledge.

**Day 8:**Today, I completed 3 projects from Week 2 and 1 project from Week 1 of the CS50: Introduction to SQL course. Additionally, I finished 2 lessons titled "Designing" and "Writing." I have also compiled a list of important concepts I learned, which I have saved in a text file from Day 8.


**Day 9:**"On Day 9, I completed the 'Viewing and Optimizing' lesson of CS50: Introduction to Databases with SQL. I learned several important concepts, including CTEs, VIEWs, and transactions. As part of the course, I also submitted solutions to two problems, each based on a different dataset. All the relevant details, including my notes on 'Viewing and Optimizing,' are available in the Day 8 folder on my GitHub."
